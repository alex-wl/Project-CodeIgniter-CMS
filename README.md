<p>
This is a slightly modified version of https://github.com/goncaloperes/Project-CodeIgniter-CMS for a test task. 
  <br>For the Test task imagine that CMS contains the following list of articles:
  
  <table>
    <tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Category ID</th>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Body</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Coronavirus disease 2019 - World Health Organization</td>
    <td>Body123</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public</td>
    <td>Body123</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>What is Coronavirus? - The New York Times</td>
    <td>Body123</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
